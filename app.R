# 1. Shiny Apps have two basic parts to them
#
#   - The user interface (UI) defines how the app should look.
#
#     -- For example, the text on the page, the placement of the elements, etc.
#
#   - The server defines how the app should behave.
#
#     -- This is how live elements are updated - like selecting a state from a list.
#
#   - Those two pieces are combined by running shinyApp(ui, server) to create the app.
#
#      -- You can also click the green "Run App" button on the top right or
#         run runApp() in the console

    # - UIs are built from "panel" functions, which specify areas of your page.

    # Here is a sidebar!

      selectInput(
        inputId = "selected_state",                 # a name for the value you choose here

      # - You can also make your UI more complicated with UI elements.
      #
      #   -- In general, these are defined by functions that you give arguments to 
      #      (e.g. min and max values).
      #
      # - These include:
      #
      #   -- selectInput() to choose from multiple options.
      #
      #   -- sliderInput() lets you choose a value from a slider of values you define.
      #
      #   -- radioButtons() let you choose a button from a number of options
      #
      #   -- textInput() lets you enter whatever text you want.
      #
      #   -- Lots of other options, like entering a date. Look at the resources for 
      #      other choices!
      #
      # - You then assign these inputs to a value and use those values in other places, 
      #   like in plots!
      #
      # - All of these functions have their own arguments. For example:
      
      radioButtons(
        inputId = "selected_color",             # a name for the value you choose here
        label = "Choose a color!",              # the label to display above the buttons

        inputId = "entered_text",               # a name for the value you choose here
        label = "Place your title text here:",  # a label above the text box
        value = "Example Title"                 # an initial value for the box
      ),

      textOutput("size_message"),
